## Votes Anonymous

Votes anonymous is a dApp game you can use settle disputes by voting whose proposal you'd like the most anonymously. You can use it for just about anything, whether it's what to make for dinner, or your next holiday destination. Fairness is guaranteed because no one can see the names and addresses of the participants and winner until votes have ended... or at least that's what I'm designing it to do.

... Still under construction.

First, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
